Acknowledgements: The online resources I used were the associative array readings, the eboard, and arrays in the JavaDoc oracle. I also worked with Medhashree Adhkilari and Connor Heagy to talk about ideas for the mini-project. I also got help from the tutors: Diogo, Simon, Boston, Elizabeth, and Jayson. On my revision, I recieved help from the tutors: Ellie, Diogo, and Ishitha. I also recieved help from Professor Rebelsky on my redo as well.  


Short Description: The associative array takes a generic pair of a <K, V> type consisting of a key and a value. It adds generic pairs of keys and values to the array with the set function. It retrieves a value given a key in the associative array with the get function. It can remove values given a key with the remove function. There are other function as well that manipulate what is in the associative array and what is not in the associative array. 

Instructions for Running the Program: Go to AssociativeArrayTests.java file and run the tests to see if they pass.
